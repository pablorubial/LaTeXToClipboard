# LaTeXToClipboard

This script automates the process of a [Pix2Text](https://github.com/breezedeus/Pix2Text)-based script. It captures a screenshot, extracts LaTeX-formatted text from it, and copies the result to the clipboard. It offers an open-source alternative to proprietary tools like [Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com/snipping-tool). We refer to [Pix2Text](https://github.com/breezedeus/Pix2Text) for further details.

# Prerequisites
**gnome-screenshot** to make a screenshot. In case you have not installed it yet:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot
  ```
**xclip** for clipboard management. In case you have not installed it yet:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
```
**awk** to extract content using regular exppressions from log files. In case you have not installed it yet:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gawk
```

# Setup

Clone this repository and locate it in a folder comfortable to the user. In my case I have chosen the following location:
```bash
mkdir $HOME/software
cd $HOME/software
git clone https://github.com/pablorubial/LaTeXToClipboard.git
```
Go to that folder and create there a Python virtual environment:
```bash
cd LaTeXToClipboard
python3 -m venv .myvenv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .myvenv/bin/activate
```

Install the packages from the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With this setup, we can run the `Run.py` file, which takes an image from `$HOME/software/LaTeXTOClipboard/images/` and after applying a math recognition algorithm from [Pix2Text](https://github.com/breezedeus/Pix2Text), the output is displayed. Now, let us take advantage of this library and automatize the following process:

1. Take a screenshot of the desired formula in order to get its LaTeX expression.
2. Send that image to the `images` folder of this repository.
3. Run the `Run.py` file and save the output to a temporal file.
4. Extract the content between $$ symbols which contains the LaTeX expression.
5. Copy that expression to clipboard.

All these instructions can be written as a bash script (`.sh` file) inside a folder called `shortcuts` that is inside the `software` folder automating the process. So, let us generate the mentioned folder:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/software/shortcuts
cd $HOME/software/shortcuts
```

then create the following `.sh` file called, for example, `latex_clipboard.sh`, and put the following content inside:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Take the screenshot and send it to $HOME/software/LaTeXToClipboard/images/
gnome-screenshot -a -f $HOME/software/LaTeXToClipboard/images/test.jpg

# Process the image using pix2text and save the output in a temporal file
source $HOME/software/LaTeXToClipboard/.myenv/bin/activate
python3 $HOME/software/LaTeXToClipboard/src/Run.py |& tee /tmp/python_output.log
deactivate

# Extract all content between $$ and $$ and copy it to the clipboard
awk '/\$\$/ {flag=!flag; next} flag' /tmp/python_output.log | xclip -selection clipboard
```
Now, you have to make that file executable:
```bash
chmod +x $HOME/software/shortcuts/latex_clipboard.sh
```

Once the `.sh` file is executable, we can create a linux custom shortcut such that, whenenever it is executed, it runs the `.sh` file. In my case I linked the `.sh` file to the 'Ctrl' + 'Alt' + 'p' keyboard combination. This can be done as follows:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./media/shortcut.png" alt="Demo" style="height: 500px;">
</div>


# Usage
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the latex_clipboard.sh script. This will help users understand how to effectively utilize your tool.

Example:

1. Activate the Shortcut:

  * Press the keyboard combination you assigned (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + P) to run the latex_clipboard.sh script.

2. Select the Desired Area:

  * Use the crosshair cursor to select the area of the screen containing the formula you wish to capture.
3. Paste the LaTeX Code:

  * The extracted LaTeX-formatted text is now copied to your clipboard.
  * Paste it into your LaTeX editor or document as needed.
